# Hybrid Simulation Modelling for Orthopaedics 

This is a repository of the hybrid simulation model that I am developing for 
my PhD.

The model is written in Python 3.9.7, with the requirements in requirements.txt.

For more information on obtaining PDFAs used in the model, please visit my
other repository, [pattern_mining](https://github.com/MHowells/pattern_mining).
